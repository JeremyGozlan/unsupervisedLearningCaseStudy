# Unsupervised Learning Case Study


The Data


UFO Sightings

A data set of UFO sighting reports was collected from [The National UFO Reporting Center Online Database](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports.html); you can see an example report [here](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/133/S133931.html). The data, downloadable as a zipped `json` file [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ufodatafordarren/ufodata.json.zip), contains the URL, raw HTML for that URL, and the time it was scraped for each report in the database along with the remnants of a database id.

Goal : Play with the data and find relevant informations!

A huge part of the challenge for this case study was getting the data into a usable form.
